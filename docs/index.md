## About Me

I am **Sunday Usman**, a 4th year Ph.D. student in the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona, United States. My research focuses on lifecycle assessments, techno-economic analyses, and rare earth metal recycling, with an emphasis on innovative processes such as magnet-to-magnet recycling for NdFeB magnets. Other areas of my research include the application of Geographic Information Systems for site suitability analysis.
