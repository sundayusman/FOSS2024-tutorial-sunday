<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am <strong>Sunday Usman</strong>, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Systems and Industrial Engineering at the University of Arizona, United States. My research focuses on lifecycle assessments, techno-economic analyses, waste-to-energy conversion, and rare earth metal recycling, with a particular emphasis on innovative processes for clean energy applications. Additionally, I explore the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for site suitability analysis.
